Project Spec Feedback
=====================

**Side note**: Alan, remove that Thumbs.db from the Git repository.

### Product Backlog (10/10)

### Data Models (7/10)

  * The models are missing some significant detail. Particularly, it's unclear what datatypes you are using to represent some of the fields. For example, what type is 'User#stats' and what is 'Lobby#character_position'? (What *is* the latter representing, anyway?)

  * There are large abstractions or relations that are missing from this diagram. For example, if a Player can be in a game room, how is that represented? If a 'ChatBox' is a single message, then how are you representing Players who are in this room?

  * Are you storing the password for each user?!

### Wireframes or Mock-ups (9/10)

  * One thing that is missing is the design/mockups for the game itself. Without some prior thought in this, you may be setting yourself up for completing a less-spectacular game than you want. Particularly since the description for this game includes some very complex elements like jumping, shooting, and enemies.

### Sprint 1 Planning (10/10)

  * Good job.
